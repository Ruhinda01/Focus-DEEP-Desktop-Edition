# FOCUS-DEEP: A Deep Focus Timer Application

This is a progressive web application that is focused to be a clean and stripped out to give a clean user interface that allows the user to stick to deep work sessions rather than short busts of 25 minute sessions.

This application is a sequel to the [FOCUS web application](https://github.com/Ruhinda01/Focus) done for my final school project.
